			<div id="content">
				<p>In northeastern Pennsylvania, several counties make up the Anthracite Coal Region, a region which is dominated by its presence of anthracite coal and its coal mines.</p>
				<p>Those counties are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Northumberland, Columbia, Schuylkill, Carbon, Luzerne, Lackawanna</li>
				</ol>
				<p>These counties were dominated by mainly German and Eastern European immigrants from coal companies going overseas to hire cheap labor."
